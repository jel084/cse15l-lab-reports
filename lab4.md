# **Lab Report 4**
In this lab report, I will be reproducing the tasks from Week 7 lab.

## **Part 1** Log into ieng6

## **Part 2** Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account
Keys pressed: < up >< up >< up >< up >< up >< up >< enter >
  
I did this to access my previous command I used to clone the fork of my repository from my Github account.

## **Part 3** Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
Keys pressed: < up > < up >< up >< up >< enter >, < up >< up >< up >< up >< enter > 
  
The javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java command was 4 up in the search history, so I used up arrows. java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ... command was 4 up in the history, so I accessed with arrow keys.

## **Part 4** Edit the code file to fix the failing test
To edit from the command line, I typed vim ListExamples.java to access the file.

The error is that index1 is used instead of index2 in the final loop in merge. To fix my errors I entered:

/index, < enter > < shift > < e > < r > < 2 >, :wq, < enter >


## **Part 5** Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed

## **Part 6** Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account
